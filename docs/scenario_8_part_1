                        SCENARIO 8, PART 1: MIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first part of scenario 8, which takes place outdoors in Kalari
Peninsula.

Galas and the rest have just been forced to land on unknown territory due to a
sea storm almost destroying the ship and making it impossible to continue
navigating to the Far North. As they explore the foggy forest, they find
themselves under attack by guards of the Iron Council, led by Mal Kendria of the
Triad.

When they attempt to attack her, they are surrounded by even more enemies.
