                            SCENARIO 11: THE QUEEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Shaxthal hive of Wesmere, shaxthal reproduction and breeding is
unattended; they have developed their own means of survival there after the
Chaos forces withdrew. However, as a result, the hive is now governed by the
only shaxthal capable of giving birth to larvae: the Queen.

The map begins as a continuation of the earlier scenario, that leads the player
to an antechamber guarded by some rayblades and a powerful Devastator Drone.
Once the guards are defeated, the player can proceed into the central area with
the hive queen.

The scenario is speechless only until the point the heroes reach the
antechamber. Then everything turns chatty.

After Elynia and Mal Keshar enter the main chamber, their original path is
blocked and a new path is opened once it is the apropriate moment.
