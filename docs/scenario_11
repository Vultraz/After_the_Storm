                            SCENARIO 11: THE QUEEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Shaxthal hive of Wesmere, shaxthal reproduction and breeding is
unattended; they have developed their own means of survival there after the
Chaos forces withdrew. However, as a result, the hive is now governed by the
only shaxthal capable of giving birth to larvae: the Queen.

The map begins as a continuation of the earlier scenario, that spawns the Hive
Queen in the prestart event and triggers the initial dialogue. There's no
turning back - impassable hex overlays won't let Elynia or Mal Keshar lure the
Queen out of her safe chamber.

The Queen "recruits" (triggered by WML actually) drones while standing on the
center of her chamber. The player can actually move Elynia over those
keep-overlay hexes and recruit some weak undead.

As the Queen is defeated, Mal Keshar is seriously weakened but offers to
detonate the explosives in the hive's energy flow systems nonetheless. Elynia
must make it out of the hive before he is overrun by shaxthal creatures and
is left with no choice but to immediately destroy the hive.

While Elynia is running out of the hive, an earthquake begins (FIXME: reasons?)
and she finds herself trapped in a blocked corridor. Then, she remembers the
teleportation spell she acquired at Zocthanol, but as she pronounces the words
of power, Mal Keshar detonates the explosives and the heat from the explosion
makes Elynia teleport to an unknown location and time.

*** INITIAL OBJECTIVES:

    - Destroy the Queen and remove Yechnagoth's core from existence

    DEFEAT:
        - Death of Elynia
        - Turns run out
