*** WML EVENT (START):

    Elynia and Mal Keshar start with less HP than their maximum. The exact
    amount of HP is a random percentage of their maximum, above 75% and below
    100%.

    Elynia: Why did he... why did he have to...

    Mal Keshar: There's no time for this, lass! We need to get out of this
            place now if we want to have any chance to destroy that monster and
            avenge... avenge the... avange Galas!

        Defeat: Death of Elynia or Mal Keshar
    >

*** WML EVENT (MOVETO, NEAR IVYEL):

    Ivyel: She says I must defeat you. She commands me to destroy you.

    Mal Keshar: This thing... this abomination speaks!

    Ivyel: I shall destroy you.

    Elynia: You'll not succeed.

*** WML EVENT (LAST BREATH, IVYEL):

    Ivyel: She says I must retreat. She commands me to go back home.

    <Ivyel moves "into" the walls>

    Mal Keshar: Where the hell is that thing going?

    Mal Keshar: It seems we have reached a dead end.

    Elynia: No... that cannot be possible! It cannot be in vain! It CANNOT!

    <Elynia blasts a certain wall hex revealing a watery path>

    Mal Keshar: Uhm, well that was not a useful thing to do, was it? Wait -
                there is a canal behind that wall. Maybe we could escape
                following the stream.

    Elynia: Let's go then.
