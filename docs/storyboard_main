Scenario 6: The Elves of Quenoth Isle
*************************************
A: Cutscene with view of whole Isle
B: Cutscene under the Great Tree


**********************************
Scenario 7: Searching for the Past
**********************************

Elynia and the rest enter a cave leading deeper underground. They
eventually find the scattered remains of Yechnagoth's core, and then, a gigantic
steel door, which cannot be opened except via a switch hidden underwater.

After activating the switch, they find behind the door a big chamber, filled with
corpses of different creatures, many of them severely mangled. Beneath a hidden
wall they find another chamber, filled with broken glyphs, except for two - one that
grants Elynia a spell of teleportation (apparently crafted by Argan), and another that talks about Argan's discovery
of Yechnagoth's heart in a 'fallen star'. The corpses are of creatures which she fed upon
to grow up. Yechnagoth's psychic influence over other creatures allowed him to gain their
trust and respect, and call upon more of her kind "from the skies" to help him build the
army of hell Uria wanted to send to take over Irdya once a great enough connection was
made between both worlds.

Elynia remembers the Glyph that she had found in Argan's lair before. She reads it during
the Long Night, and learns the awful truth: the shaxthals won't stop consuming Irdya until
it is turned into a giant sphere of dirt.

The group decides that the remaining shaxthal hives must be destroyed - but they need
clues of their locations (besides the Wesmere one), and the only place where more information
could be found was buried into Hell - Argan's Lair.


**********************************
Scenario 8: One must fall (Part A)
**********************************

Galas and the rest travel back to the Great Continent, but when reaching the
coastline, a storm destroys the ship. They manage to escape -- but only to land
on enemy territory. They have arrived to the Kalari Peninsula, where the Iron
Triad headquarters are located.

Victory conditions: standard

The player can recruit/recall units on first turn only, then the encampment is
dismantled.

Start event:

< move_unit_fake a transport galleon >

< move_unit_fake heroes to shore >

- Elynia: that was a close call... is everyone all right?
- Galas: barely... we have lost our provisions. Where are we?
- Mal Keshar: judging by the palm trees, I'd say a jungle.
- Elynia: this is the Kalari Peninsula - in my times it was often said that this
  place was cursed.
- Mal Keshar: Wasn't the same said of a thousand other perfectly nice locations?
- Kri'tan: There's something familiar to me about this place. I don't exactly
  know what it is.
- Galas: Elynia, how far are we from Wesmere then?
- Elynia: Um... if it serves as a reference, if we go north-east, we'll find
  again that path we used to go North before.
- Galas: That's good. Let's move then.

Sighted enemies:

- Enemy unit: Intruders! Alert the masters!
- Other enemy unit: As you command, sir!

< move_unit_fake this other enemy unit to somewhere not visible >

- Enemy unit: How you dare step in the Iron Council's territory, vermin!
- Mal Keshar: Iron Council?! Oh, nuts. Of all the places where we could land
              on...
- Elynia: This is not good. Our forces are too weak from the accident! We cannot
          fight them!
- Galas: But it is a peninsula... the only way out, if not by sea, is through.
- Elynia: Right... I pray that we won't fall to their forces.

Defeated enemy leaders:

- Elynia: we did it!
- Galas: uhh...

< spawn high-level chaos soldiers around heroes >

- Mal Keshar: No! We are surrounded!


**********************************
Scenario 8: One must fall (Part B)
**********************************

The heroes are brought to the deeper reaches of the Council's monastery. Elynia
and Mal Keshar are chained up to prevent them from using their powers. Galas has
been tied and rid of their weapons. Elynia has been rid of her staff, too, and a
guard has it in his hands.

This guard is Iveryl.

Elynia and Mal Keshar are set to half their HP at start. The 3 heroes have the
'slowed' status activated.

< disable recalls and recruits for this scenario >

< spawn Mal Hekuba (Ancient Lich), Mal Kendria (female Necromancer) and
  Nar-hamoth (Chaos Warlord) after MUFing them >

- Mal Hekuba: What do we have here? The fish have trapped themselves in the net!
- Elynia: you... again...
- Mal Hekuba: You are nothing without your stupid Union, girl. How pathetic.
- Galas: you cruel monster, set them free from those chains, you are torturing
         them!
- Mal Kendria: that's exactly what we want! Hahahaha! May them burn with the
               cold iron for the rest of their days!
- Iveryl: masters, the filthy fairy was wielding this staff! She tried with all
          her will to get it back, so we decided to chain her up.

* Iveryl hands the staff to Mal Hekuba *

- Nar-hamoth: Wise decission, and excellent acquisition!
- Iveryl: there was a small boy, too, but we couldn't capture him...
- Nar-hamoth: that doesn't matter. The sentry drones will soon find and devour
              him. You, murderers of the Shadow Master, do you know what this
              is?
- Mal Kendria: the ancient race kept a great weapon as a symbol of their
               high dinasties, and it was inherited amongst generations.
- Elynia: the sceptre... of... fire...
- Mal Hekuba: haha! Exactly! We have been looking for it for centuries, and it
              has miracleously [FIXME] come to us by itself! The Ruby always had
              its own will, and it is why the leaders of the ancient race
              decided to lock down its power under the sceptre's hard and dense
              metal shell.
- Mal Kendria: when the old Kingdom of Wesnoth was teared apart by the barbarian
               invaders of the damned eastern lands, the sceptre was thought
               lost, but the great Lord Demon informed us that the elves had
               sent this girl to recover it!
- Mal Hekuba: and those stinky midgets helped her remove the core and hide it
              in her staff. Good plan, but futile in the end. You tried to stop
              the enemies of ancient race from using it against them.
- Elynia: yes... the likes of you... should not possess such... power...
- Mal Hekuba: but the Ruby searches for us! From my ancestor, the Lord Jevyan,
              to the Triad of the Iron Council! You couldn't prevent or predict
              that.
- Mal Keshar: listen... that thing will be... your doom if you... misuse its
              power...
- Mal Hekuba: shut up, you, tainted necromancer. You are not in position to
              teach us anything!
- Galas: now it is clear... but what do you want to do with it?
- Nar-hamoth: use it, of course. But not to kill insignificant creatures; we'll
              need all the power of this artifact to open the connection that
              was lost when the Shadow Master was assassined.
- Elynia: no... no...
- Mal Hekuba: (imitating) 'No, no, no!' Pathetic!
- Nar-hamoth: When we bring the Inferno and Uria to this world, you will be at
              the top of the list of sacrifices! Uria is really thirsty of
              revenge on you all!

< MUF some kind of fake boulder projectile and make it "hit" one of the guards,
  killing him >
< recall/spawn Kri'tan in middle of the room, along with two L2 skeletons and a
  Dark Adept; all of them adjacent to the heroes >

- Sumnur (other guard): the boy!
- Mal Kendria: kill him!

< Kri'tan quickly sets Galas free (unslow) >

- Galas: <dark adept name> free them from those chains!
- <dark adept>: yes, master Galas!

< Mal Keshar and Elynia are set free (unslowed) and fully healed >

- Mal Hekuba: Not so fast! The castle is well guarded and Iviel is not going to
              allow you to leave this room now!

< MUF and spawn Ivyel (boss unit) - L3+1 Shaxthal Rayblade >

{BOSS_AMBIENTANCE}

- Ivyel: you aren't going anywhere, foolish creatures!
- Mal Keshar: whoa... Argan's first creation.
- Elynia: he is right... we are at disadvantage here.

< Mal Kendria descends from the keep and approaches them >

- Galas: Elynia, Mal Keshar, Kri'tan... it is still possible that you escape if
         the Triad gets slowed down long enough.
- Mal Keshar: eh... how?
- Mal Keshar: wait lad... you aren't suggesting...
- Elynia: Galas, what will you do!?
- Galas: I will attempt to stop them from attacking you, but you must make haste
         to the exit, NOW!
- Elynia: Galas... no...
- Galas: Elynia... I love you... now run!
- Mal Keshar: lad...
- Galas: GO! GET TO THE EXIT!       <this line is a Predator reference, got it?>

< set the Impassable overlay ( ^Zb ) around the keep so the other triad members
  cannot approach the party or viceversa; Nar-hamoth and Mal Hekuba are switched
  to a enemy side which uses the idle_ai algorithm. >

< set player objectives:

    Victory
        - Mal Keshar, Elynia and Kri'tan defeat Ivyel and exit the room
        -       and
        - Galas must vanquish Mal Kendria afterwards (not before)

    Defeat
        - Death of Elynia
        - Death of Mal Keshar
        - Death of Kri'tan
        - Death of Galas before Mal Kendria is vanquished
        - Death of Mal Kendria before Mal Keshar, Elynia and Kri'tan escape

    Notes
        - Your supporting units should exit the room to escape, otherwise they
          won't be carried over to next scenario.
>

Event: last breath [Ivyel]

- Ivyel: Noooo!!!


Event: last breath [Galas]
# Used both for normal death and a forced [kill] with fire_event=yes

- Galas: I love you... Elynia...
# following may occur even when Elynia has escaped - it doesn't matter
- Elynia: Galas, NOO!!!
# if the heroes have not escaped, the sole fact that there are no player units
# with canrecruit=yes will cause instant defeat.


Event: die [Mal Kendria - before the heroes escape*]

- Galas: no! This was not the plan!
- Mal Hekuba: by the power passed unto me, I call upon the flames of the Ruby of
              Fire, may it burn our enemies!
< lighting effects, sounds of flame >
< remaining player units are killed (fire_event=yes side=1 animate=yes) >


Event: victory

If Galas is still here for some really weird reason, kill him. Make Elynia a
canrecruit=yes unit.


Event: moveto <exit locations> [Mal Keshar or Elynia or Kri'tan]

The hero that moves to this location is put to recall list.
If Galas moves to this location, nothing happens.
Other units may move to this location; then they are put into the recall list.
Now check if the three heroes managed to escape. If that condition is true, the
following event handlers are created.*
*
*   Event: last breath [Mal Kendria - after the heroes escape*]
*
*   - Mal Kendria: curse you, tree-shagger!
*
*   Event: die [Mal Kendria - after the heroes escape*]
*
*   < remove the impassable overlays from the keep >
*
*   - Mal Hekuba: ha ha ha, well done! Very good for a simple fighter.
*   - Galas: now it's just you and me!
*   - Nar-hamoth: this will be your end, elf.
*
*   < set player objectives:
*       Victory
*           - Try to defeat the other two members of the Triad
*       Defeat
*           - Death of Galas
*       Notes
*           - Your defeat here is not the end of this history.
*   >
*
*   Event: an attack hits Mal Hekuba or Nar-hamoth below 50% their max_hitpoints
*
*   - Mal Hekuba: by the power passed unto me, I call upon the flames of the
*                 Ruby of Fire! May it destroy our enemy!
*   - Galas: oh no...
*   <lighting effects, sounds of flame>
*   - Galas: aaaaaaaahhhhh...
*   <kill Galas (fire_event=yes animate=yes)>
*   - Nar-hamoth: and so passes Galas, one of the murderers of the great Shadow
*                 Master!
*   - Mal Hekuba: perhaps not so great after all... at least not without this!
*                 The Ruby of Fire would have secured his power!
*   <if there are other player units remaining
*     <lighting effects, sounds of flame>
*     <kill other player units on map (fire_event=yes animate=yes)>

**************************************
Scenario 10: Tears - Return to Wesmere
**************************************

< Story block
    Elynia cried and cried, for she knew that Galas would not survive to the
    power of the Iron Triad.

    < still in story block, use dialogue format
        - Elynia: how could... how could I let this happen?

        - Mal Keshar: don't blame yourself. The elements wanted us to arrive to
                      that cursed peninsula; nobody could possibly predict that
                      accident. We didn't know what was in there either...

        - Elynia: first it was Argan... now Galas. It seems that anyone who gets
                  too close to... my heart, will suffer a terrible death.

        - Mal Keshar: aw, come on! Don't be silly. These are... just coincidences...

        - Elynia: you can't know how it feels.

        - Mal Keshar: ah, what you say? If you did not notice already, I also have
                      emotions, and for me, Galas was my only friend in the world.
                      He accepted me, and we helped each other in times of difficulty.

        - Mal Keshar: Nobody else would accept a necromancer as companion! Nobody
                      had given me a second oportunity of proving that I didn't want
                      to do so much harm at the beginning!

        - Elynia: well... I feel sorry for saying that...
    >

    Elynia cleared the tears from her face, and looked towards the North mountains.

    <
        - Elynia: what will we do now? The enemy has the Ruby. They will shortly use
                  its power to summon Inferno again, and this time nobody will be
                  able to stop them... and those biomechanical creatures are there to
                  help them destroy the lands.

        - Mal Keshar: what about the power of the Union?

        - Elynia: the prophecy said that the Union could be summoned only when two
                  beings, wielding the essence of light and darkness, were tied
                  together by the 'Unbreakable' force. That force was love.
        
        - Mal Keshar: oh.

        - Elynia: so it's not an option. When Argan died, the powers must have
                  been left free in his lair, now buried in that other world.

        - Elynia: the only option left is to return and recover the Ruby
                  before it's too late.
