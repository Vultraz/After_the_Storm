*************************
EPISODE I: FEAR AND DEATH
*************************

After defeating the Shadow Master, the group of Galas, Elynia and Mal Keshar
set on a quest to learn what Yechnagoth's fate really was, and what her relation
with the Chaos followers is. In their route to Zocthanol Isle, they discover
that the continental elves are in a bitter civil war again. The Council of War
of the renewed Northern Alliance suspects that followers of Uria were sent to
commit the elvish lord's murder in order to cause strife amongst elves. Elynia
also finds an amnesiac and tortured human kid, Kri'Tan, in the dungeon of an
undead lord, follower of Uria. Elynia soon starts treating the child as her own.

In Zocthanol isle, Galas, Elynia and Mal Keshar learn that Yechnagoth was not
completely destroyed, because Uria ordered Argan to remove her core and move it
to the shaxthal breeding facilities in the ruined plains of Wesmere in order to
preserve the creature's powers. In the mean time, Elynia learns from a glyph a
spell of teleportation, supposedly used by Argan for traveling back and forth
between Zocthanol and the valley of Weldyn.

The group is attacked by shaxthal creatures when close to land back to the
Great Continent, but after the enemies abandon thinking their targets are
destroyed, Elynia and the rest make it to land at the Kalari Peninsula, were
their presence is quickly noticed by the Iron Triad and they are captured, and
brought chained up to the court of the triad. There, Mal Kendria, Mal Hekuba
and Nar-hamoth attempt to steal the Ruby of Fire, which had been embedded into
Elynia's staff ("the Staff of Elynia-Niryone") during the times of the Kingdom
of Wesnoth. Their plan is frustrated by the appareance of the only oponent whom
they could not find at the peninsula, Kri'tan, and Elynia gets her staff back;
however, Galas sacrifices his life to allow Elynia, Kri'tan and Mal Keshar to
escape the cultists. Despite his sacrifice, Elynia and the rest have to fight an
enemy boss when escaping the dark keep: Ivyel, a L3 shaxthal rayblade. They
cannot defeat her, but manage to severely harm and get pass her.

A beset Elynia secures the help from the dwarves again, to destroy the breeding
facilities at Wesmere, with Yechnagoth's core, using powerful explosive
chemicals. Kri'tan is left behind by Elynia with the dwarves, as she could not
bear a possible loss of the child.

Mal Keshar and Elynia, alone, descend into the Wesmere hive and try to find
Yechnagoth's core. At the deepest reaches they stumble upon a colossal shaxthal
creature, dubbed 'The Queen' by them. Mal Keshar and Elynia believe this
creature has Yechnagoth's core inside of its body. They are surrounded by the
creatures, and Mal Keshar notices that the tube system inside the hive carries
inflammable liquids. He decides to sacrifice himself by using the dwarven
ammunitions to destroy the whole hive taking advantage of the flow system
tubes. After struggling to convince Elynia that it's the only fate possible for
him, and that must leave for Kri'tan needs her help, Mal Keshar sacrifices
himself to destroy the hive. However, his plan fails, and not only Elynia is
surrounded at an upper level and the hive and does not manage to escape before
Mal Keshar is forced to detonate the bomb, but also the explosion covers a
broader area of the surface than expected.

Kri'tan and the dwarves quickly appear and start searching for Elynia and Mal
Keshar, but they can't find one or another amongst the scattered remainings of
shaxthal exoskeletons; however, they come across Elynia's staff's top, damaged
and covered in dry blood. They are certain that Elynia and Mal Keshar were
destroyed by the explosion.

Meanwhile, at an unknown breeding facility, Mal Kendria and Mal Hekuba insert a
strange device inside Ivyel's body, which is now mostly covered by skin that
almost perfectly resembles Elynia's.


*****************************************************
EPISODE II: IMITATION OF LIFE (Int. Thunderstone Era)
*****************************************************

An elf, which very closely resembles Elynia except for her lack of faerie wings
and missing staff, arrives at the territory of the northmost fraction of the
conflicting Sylvans. She claims to be Elynia, attacked and tortured by soldiers
under the command of the Northern Alliance, who was only saved by the discovery
of interesting approaches to life substenance in a shaxthal hive. She displays
extremely advanced powers in order to further convince the elves that she's the
true Elynia.

At an unknown forest, Elynia wakes up, naked and injured; she remembers the
explosion, and that she used the teleportation spell when she was surrounded by
heavy attack drones. Not being able to control the spell correctly, she was
caught by the explosion while casting it, and gets thrown away at an unknown
distant location in the future without her clothes and her master's staff. She
is helped by a band of human hunters and learns that she is in the Moon Valley,
between the Heart Mountains.

Receving supplies and clothes from the hunters, Elynia fights her way to
the north of the Great Continent, and meets the Aragwaith in the Grand Council,
not without being treated like an enemy first. She finds a 16 years old Kri'tan
- 7 years passed since the destruction of the Wesmere hive. The members of the
Northern Alliance reveal to her that war has not passed, and that they are
currently fighting rebel elvish troops in the south-eastern forests who are
suspected to be closely related to the swarms of shaxthal creatures who have
begun to spread all over the continent. Elynia learns that an elvish warlord of
her same appearance is guiding the rebels and usurping her title of Lady of
Light.

Kri'tan gives Elynia her restored staff, and both travel to the south-eastern
frontiers of the country along with the dark sorceress Zynavu-Malal, one of Mal
Keshar's former disciples.

A clash of armies occurs, and they meet not only elves at the frontier, but also
highly advanced shaxthal creatures that intended to invade the lands of the
Northern Alliance. Surrounded and only protected by their undead minions,
Elynia, Kri'tan and Zynavu-Malal try to resist for as long as possible, until an
elvish battalion appears to fight for the Alliance. The band is led out of the
crossfire by the Elvish High Lord Retnaen and the Elvish Avatar Unarye. They are
informed of a possible backdoor through a river that, although well guarded,
leads directly to the place whence the shaxthal swarms seem to come from - the
valley of Elynia.

Elynia, Kri'tan and Zynavu-Malal follow the river through the vast desert.
However, when they are at the "gates of Hell", Zynavu-Malal reveals to be
Mal-Zynara, sent by Mal Kendria and Nar-hamoth to protect the Shaxthal hive of
Ivyel, in which Mal Hekuba is attempting to unleash the forces of Uria yet
again. Mal-Zynara turns her undead minions against Elynia and Kri'tan to obtain
the Ruby of Fire, which Mal Hekuba needs to obtain the power required to merge
the location with Inferno.

However, Elynia reveals that she can (and has) used the Ruby of Fire in the
past to raise the undead, including Mal Keshar when she once destroyed his body
believing he was an enemy seeking the Ruby in the depths of Knalga. She also
raises undead minions and overcomes Mal-Zynara's forces. That calls upon
Ivyel's attention, who emerges from the hive to defend the entrance along with a
group of elvish cultists. Elynia meets Ivyel again, this time disguised as
herself with identical skin, hair and eyes, features not natural to a Shaxthal
creature. While fighting, Ivyel acknowledges that her insides and her skin are
copies of the original Elynia, built from samples of her bodily fluids taken by
Argan's minions at the dark keep on Weldyn, improved by powers provided by the
core of the alien Yechnagoth. Elynia uses the sheer power of the Ruby of Fire
to incinerate Ivyel, and since the latter disappears, she believes she has
already killed her for good, and after gaining the trust of a few elves (who
notice they have been deceived), enters the dark hive with Kri'tan, who has
begun to recall dark memories from his past.

Once inside the hive, Elynia and the rest stumble upon all kinds of drone and
are forced to leave some units behind to distract them so they can reach Mal
Hekuba and terminate the existence of the most powerful member of the Iron
Triad.

They do not only meet new weaponry and creatures at the center of the hive, but
also a heavy-armored Mal Hekuba powered by shaxthal machinery. The lich becomes
confused when he detects Kri'tan's identity - he doesn't get to reveal it, as
Ivyel reappears first, with most of her skin gone or deteriorated beyond
repair, and starts fighting Elynia and Kri'tan.

Hekuba flees to a deeper level to continue his rituals. Elynia tries to
convince Ivyel to give up her fight, and that she shouldn't obey her creator's
will if she really wants to fulfill her own purpose - one that she won't admit
but Elynia detects.

Ivyel is confused by these ideas and Elynia and Kri'tan take this opportunity to
disable her to gain enough time for pursuing Mal Hekuba.

At the end, Elynia confronts Hekuba along with Kri'tan, and Hekuba reveals that
Kri'tan is an experiment made by Argan to fulfill Elynia's oldest desire - a
son. With Hekuba becoming more and more powerful with the fight, Elynia as a
last resort, pierces his metallic exoskeleton with her staff and blasts his
body to pieces with the power of the Ruby. Ivyel witnessess her creator's
decease and flees scared by the sole idea of not having a master to command her.

Elynia and Kri'tan, exhausted, leave the hive, but they meet a battalion, loyal
to the Alliance, commanded by the Archmage Ignatius, who tells them of the
defeat of the rebel elves and assures them that he and his troops will take
care of destroying and burying the hive. They also confirm having seen Ivyel,
but not being able to reach or attack her since she was surrounded by her
bodyguard drones.
