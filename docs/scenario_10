                        SCENARIO 10: RETURN TO WESMERE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the dwarvish explosives in their hands, Elynia and Mal Keshar return to
the ruins of Wesmere and enter the underground hive.

The start of this scenario begins in a map area resembling the lower half of
IftU's "Legend of Wesmere". The entrance to the hive is more or less in the
same location (shifted around), but the hive itself replaces the underground
roads that were used by Galas' band in IftU's "Under the Sands".

The normal post-Fall ToD sequence does not apply - besides the fact that Wesmere
is implied to be cursed forever by the powers of the still-alive Zhangor, most
of the map uses a custom Dark Hive ToD with a different color shift, and the
outdoor hexes are under a permanent Long Dark ToD schedule as far as the game
engine is concerned. The outdoors action is supposed to take place in a very
small timespan (less than a few hours, before the hypothetical dawn).

In their way down, Elynia and Mal Keshar encounter a few powerful midbosses. At
the final chamber, the scenario shifts to #11 for the actual boss fight.

The player can only recruit or recall {DIFF 4 3 2} units on the first turn.
Nobody can stay behind more than 8 hexes away from each other.

*** OBJECTIVES:

    VICTORY:
        - Proceed to the underground hive

    DEFEAT:
        - Death of Elynia
        - Death of Mal Keshar
        - Turns run out
