                        SCENARIO 10: RETURN TO WESMERE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the dwarvish explosives in their hands, Elynia and Mal Keshar return to
the ruins of Wesmere and enter the underground hive.

Most of the first half of this scenario's map is identical to IftU's "Legend of
Wesmere" map, with the notable difference being that the entrance to the hive
is a tad closer to the player's startup position, and the surface area is now
plagued with shaxthal creatures, and no walking corpses are around. The normal
post-Fall ToD sequence doesn't apply, like IftU: all day times are changed to
Short Dark.

This is mostly a speechless scenario, and the player cannot recruit or recall
units after turn 1.
