The group moves across the mountains, and stumble upon undead. They must defeat the

to Yechnagoth, and find a prisoner in his keep, Kri'tan - a small boy who barely
remembers his name.

    Dialogue:
        - Galas: this place gives me chills. Perhaps it was not a good choice of path
                 after all.
        - Mal Keshar: pah. Put your worries in your backpack, there is nothing to...

        < spawn unit near side 1 start location: Necrophage >
        < spawn unit near side 1 start location: Necrophage >

        - <necrophage>: groaaar!!!

        - Mal Keshar: and who called upon you?
        - Elynia: so the rumors are true. This pass is infested with undead. We'll
                  have to give them a rest before we can continue on.
        - Mal Keshar: this will be boring.

-- WML event: sighted [id=Mal Ciphan]
    Dialogue:
        - Mal Ciphan: aah, the traitors! You are not seeing the sunlight anymore,
                      I'll feed your souls to Yechnagoth!
        - Mal Keshar: the same old tune. These goons need a hobby or something.

-- WML event: sighted [id=Nyadien]
    Dialogue:
        - Nyadien: you, Galas! You abandoned us in the valley! You let all of us
                   die! You shall perish, and your soul will be tortured as you
                   deserve it!
        - Galas: Nyadien... but...
        - Mal Keshar: Do you know him?
        - Galas: yes, he was the leader of the patrol group that replaced mine
                 just before the loyalists invaded our valley.
        - Elynia: Elf, know that Galas did not have the power to stop that invasion,
                  but we have just demolished the Empire. There is nothing that
                  ties you to roam this world anymore!
        - Nyadien: I will personally make sure you don't go unpunished, traitor!
        - Mal Keshar: There is no use in trying to deal with this pile of bones.
                      The necromancer who arose him probably used some malign trick
                      to fill him of hatred towards you.
        - Galas: in that case, all we can do is finish it.

-- WML event: last breath [id=Mal Ciphan]
    Dialogue:
        - Mal Ciphan: I am vanquished, but I curse your race to never see days of
                      peace and joy again for the rest of eternity!
-- WML event: victory
    Dialogue in Mal Ciphan's keep:
        - <fake unit: Skeleton>: Sirs, you must see this!
        [<spawn Kri'tan; HP=1>]
        - Elynia: a little boy! And he is tortured... what did they beasts want from
                  him.
        - Mal Keshar: these fanatics love to torture people. Do they need a reason
                      for this?
        [<Elynia heals Kri'tan to full HP>]
        - Elynia: here, this should make you feel better. Child, can you hear us?
        - Kri'tan:  *cries of pain*
        - Elynia: what's your name?
        - Kri'tan: I... my name is... my name is... Kri'tan.
        - Elynia: what happened to your family? What did those creatures want from you?
        - Kri'tan: I... augh... I can't... remember...
        - Mal Keshar: hey, let him have some rest at least! We should set up camp here
                      and continue our journey tomorrow. This was a very long day already.
        - Galas: Indeed. Let's rest here.
