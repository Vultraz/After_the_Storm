SCENARIO 3: CIVIL WAR
---------------------

The group finally finds the elves - fighting each other. They do not recognize
Galas as a leader, nor Elynia as an authority. They can either defeat all enemy
leaders, or wait for the end of turns, when Arnesius appears to discuss a new
treaty with the elvish factions.

        Recruit list: Faerie Sprite, Elvish Shaman, Elvish Marksman, Elvish
Archer, Elvish Fighter, Elvish Scout, Elvish Hero
        Gold: {DIFF 230 270 320}
        Team: Elves (N)

Side 3: Unidë (Elvish Avenger) (female) (leader) (resilient+quick)
        Recruit List: Sprite, Elvish Shaman, Elvish Archer, Elvish Fighter, Elvish Scout
        Gold: {DIFF 250 280 330}

Side 4: Arnesius
        Team: Galas
        (dummy side)

Victory conditions: enemy defeat OR end of turns

WML EVENT: START

Elynia: Look! Elves... and they are fighting...
Mal Keshar: ... each other. What the hell?!
Galas: This is not possible. What could have divided our kinsmen?
       What is this dispute for?

<MUF and teleport side 3 leader, close to the player's encampment>

Unidë: Stop, intruders, what is your mission here?
Galas: Greetings. I am Galas of the Elves of the Valley of Elynia. What is
       occurring in this place?
Unidë: We are at war with a fraction of traitors who claim that the politics
       of our leader are wrong and that we should not trade knowledge and
       weapons with the tree-killers who are obtaining them from the fallen
       loyalist strongholds.
Galas: War? But, in the worst of times... There is no reason to fight amonst
       ourselves!
Unidë: Do you think they are called traitors now for no bussiness? They slew
       our leader, lord Inodien, and tried to murder the second-in-command as
       well? Are you supporters to their foul cause too?
Elynia: Peace! There must be a way to solve this problem without resorting to
        fighting. In these grim times, there is only war in the outside lands.
        Bringing war to our civilization here will be our doom. The traitors
        must be judged by Law, not by death.
Unidë: Who do you think you are to give me commands? I am the war-leader now. I
       obey no orders from strangers.
Mal Keshar: Show your respect, elf! This is Elynia herself, your legendary
            savior and highest leader by right!
Unidë: A true leader of our people would not allow such a crime to go
       unpunished! Neither would allow the presence of a rusty necromancer by
       her side! Step further into this forest, and we will have but strike you
       down.

<MUF and teleport side 3 leader to her original keep>

Mal Keshar: This is madness!
Elynia: Again, a small group turns small ideological differences into the bane
        of our civilization. A civil war in these times... who would have
        imagined?
Galas: We must stop this folly before too much elvish blood is spilled to the
       ground. It's essential that we capture the fraction leaders and avoid
       killing our kinsmen at all costs.
Mal Keshar: You want to avoid killing them. Fine, but they will not avoid to
            try to kill us! How are you going to handle that?
Galas: (sighs) I know, but we can still try to do our best and stay away from
       the battle for as long as it is possible. I must go and obtain help from
       the humans. If the elves cannot solve this dispute themselves, then
       perhaps the threat of the Aragwaith law will solve it for them.
Galas: Just avoid engaging in combat unless it is necessary to assure that the
       fraction leaders are not killed instead. More deaths in the highest
       ranks will only turn this mess into an unsolvable one.
Elynia: We'll do as you say Galas. Be careful in your way to the human capital.

<MUF Galas away to a map edge>

Elynia: Kri'tan, please stay close to us. I would not support to lose you at the
        hands of those demented lunatics.
Kri'tan: As you command, my lady.
Elynia: There is no need for formalities, Kri'tan. Just call me Elynia.
Kri'tan: Very well, my lady.
Elynia: (sighs)
Mal Keshar: The kid is very respectful of you. That's something to be proud of!
