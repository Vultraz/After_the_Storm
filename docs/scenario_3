                                SCENARIO 3: CIVIL WAR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The group finally finds the elves - fighting each other. They do not recognize
Galas as a leader, nor Elynia as an authority. They can either defeat all enemy
leaders, or wait for the end of turns, when Arnesius appears to discuss a new
treaty with the elvish factions.

****************
WML EVENT: START
****************

Elynia: Look! Elves... and they are fighting...
Mal Keshar: ... each other. What the hell?!
Galas: This is not possible. What could have divided our kinsmen?
       What is this dispute for?

<MUF and teleport side 3 leader, close to the player's encampment>

Unidë: Stop, intruders, what is your mission here?
Galas: Greetings. I am Galas of the Elves of the Valley of Elynia. What is
       occurring in this place?
Unidë: We are at war with a faction of traitors who claim that the politics
       of our leader are wrong and that we should not trade knowledge and
       weapons with the tree-killers who are obtaining them from the fallen
       loyalist strongholds.
Galas: War? But, in the worst of times... There is no reason to fight amonst
       ourselves!
Unidë: Do you think they are called traitors now for no reason? They have slain
       our leader, lord Inodien, and murdered the second-in-command as well! Are
       you supporters to their foul cause too?
Elynia: Peace! There must be a way to solve this problem without resorting to
        fighting. In these grim times, there is only war in the outside lands.
        Bringing it to our civilization here will be our doom. The traitors
        must be judged by Law, not by death.
Unidë: Who do you think you are to give me commands? I am the war-leader now. I
       obey no orders from strangers.
Mal Keshar: Show your respect, elf! This is Elynia herself, your legendary
            savior and highest leader by right!
Unidë: A true leader of our people would not allow such a crime to go
       unpunished! Neither would allow the presence of a rusty necromancer by
       her side! Step further into this forest, and we will have but strike you
       down.

<MUF and teleport side 3 leader to her original keep>

Mal Keshar: This is madness!
Elynia: Again, a small group turns small ideological differences into the bane
        of our civilization. A civil war in these times... who would have
        imagined?
Galas: We must stop this folly before too much elvish blood is spilled to the
       ground. It's essential that we capture the faction leaders and avoid
       killing our kinsmen at all costs.
Mal Keshar: You want to avoid killing them. Fine, but they will not avoid to
            try to kill us! How are you going to handle that?
Galas: (sighs) I know, but we can still try to do our best and stay away from
       the battle for as long as it is possible. I must go and obtain help from
       the humans. If the elves cannot solve this dispute themselves, then
       perhaps the threat of the Aragwaith law will solve it for them.
Galas: Just avoid engaging in combat unless it is necessary to assure that the
       faction leaders are not killed instead. More deaths in the highest
       ranks will only turn this mess into an unsolvable one.
Elynia: We'll do as you say Galas. Be careful in your way to the human capital.

<MUF Galas away to a map edge>

Elynia: Kri'tan, please stay close to us. I would not support to lose you at the
        hands of those demented lunatics.
Kri'tan: As you command, my lady.
Elynia: There is no need for formalities, Kri'tan. Just call me Elynia.
Kri'tan: Very well, my lady.
Elynia: (sighs)
Mal Keshar: The kid is very respectful of you. That's something to be proud of!

******************
WML EVENT: VICTORY
******************

There should be a road at the northeastern corner of the map. Galas arrives by
it with Arnesius, an orcish chieftain (Ikarol) and an elvish enchantress
(Unarye).

Arnesius: Elves, stop this disastrous bloodshed (FIXME?)! You have killed many
innocent people, of your kind, Aragwaithi and orcish allies. It is necessary to
establish a new treaty now!

Unidë: We do not listen to human sub-people!

Unarye: Then you shall listen to your authorities. I came as soon as I could to
bring order to this chaos. You were given orders by Elynia, the lady of Light;
by not listening to her, you have sealed your fate.

Arnesius: We have decided to banish you from the Aragwaith country. You shall
leave in no less than five days, or we'll summon our armies for dealing with
you! We don't want to do this, and you know you are in numerical inferiority.

Celán: What? And so one of you decided to kill the puny 'lord' to make up an
excuse for banishing our people?

Ikarol: Listen, wose-born creates, Inodien was slain by no elf, human or orc!

Unarye: We have good reasons to think that the loyalists sent forth one of their
mercenaries to do the job and let you have a petty dispute to send us all to
doom.

Unarye:
