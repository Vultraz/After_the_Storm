SCENARIO 3: CIVIL WAR
---------------------

The group finally finds the elves - fighting each other (wild elves vs. sylvans), however,
and they do not recognize Galas as a leader, nor Elynia as an authority.
They can either defeat all enemy leaders, or wait for the end of turns, when Arnesius appears
to discuss a new treaty with the elvish factions.
