Dialogue:
    - Guard #1: Night breaks, and the scouts reported by midday that those cursed soldiers were heading towards our town.
    - Guard #2: Yeah, so it was not enough for them to burn and ransack Tyannes... Blast it. The elders and their warriors,
                blast it, why don't they send us help?
    - Guard #1: Since the beginning of the War, little they have cared about safety, not only ours, but theirs too.
                Rumors indicate that the country itself is poorly defended currently. Easy prey for foreign invaders.
    - Guard #2: Not only foreign. I heard that... <hidden>(the elves)</hidden>
    - Guard #3: On guard! Three strangers approach from the southern road!

Dialogue:
    - Guard #1: Stop! Identify yourselves, strangers!
    - Galas: We are traveling and don't plan to stay in your town for more than one night. You don't need to know who we are.
    - Guard #2: Sorry, but we were ordered not to let anybody... pa... she's... beautiful.
    - Guard #3: Oh my, a fairy?
    - Elynia: Yes.
    - Guard #3: And you are an elf? What is one of your kind doing so far from the green northern lands?
    - Galas: As I said before, we are traveling, and don't plan to stay in your town for more than one night. Just let us in.
    - Guard #1: Who is that? Hey, the cloaked one!
    - Mal Keshar: Eh?
    - Guard #1: Aaah!!
    - Guard #3: Necromancer! A...
    - Elynia: You are not signaling the entire town of his presence, are you? Such a handsome man could spend the night doing... more interesting things, than fighting us...
    - Guard #3: *gulp* Eh, I...
    - Guard #1: I don't know what the hell is your purpose here, but we do have important things to do this night, such as defending the town from your cursed henchmen!
    - Galas: Henchmen? Do you see anyone else accompaining us?
    - Guard #1: Eh... uhm... well, no?
    - Galas: Well, then...

    galas steps forward
[/move_unit_fake]
    - Guard #1: Eh! That you don't bring anyone with you does not mean you cannot call upon them! We heard rumors of the cursed warriors coming to our valley!
    - Galas: Cursed, you say?
    - Mal Keshar: Clad in black armor, bringing flags with impaled skulls at the top, and smelling specially nasty?
    - Guard #2: Yes, yes. Do you know them?
    - Mal Keshar: Yeah, and I'd like to kill a few of them, just for fun.
    - Elynia: Actually, they are our enemies. We know better than you of their flaws, so we could be of help, *if* you let us pass inside the town.
    - Morzey: Let them come in! We are in need of all the help we can get if we do not want to suffer the same fate of our comrades at Tyannes, and it is not the first time I hear of a necromancer helping our cause.
    - Guard #1: Yes, sir!
    - Guard #3: As you desire, sir!

    everyone of side1 moves close to Morzey
[/move_unit_fake]
    - Morzey: Strangers, please help us. I am sure the gate guards already told you of the situation...
    - Galas: Yes, they did.
    - Morzey: Well, I think you can be trusted. Please aid us in this battle; plagues have decimated most of our capable warriors, and all we have left is the town militia...
    - Galas: We'll do. Just don't ask names.
    - Morzey: Very well. I don't know when or whether they'll arrive or not, so stay alert.

**********************************
Scenario 8: Searching for the Past
**********************************

Elynia and the rest enter a cave leading deeper underground. They
eventually find the scattered remains of Yechnagoth's core, and then, a gigantic
steel door, which cannot be opened except via a switch hidden underwater.

After activating the switch, they find behind the door a big chamber, filled with
corpses of different creatures, many of them severely mangled. Beneath a hidden
wall they find another chamber, filled with broken glyphs, except for two - one that
grants Elynia a spell of teleportation (apparently crafted by Argan), and another that talks about Argan's discovery
of Yechnagoth's heart in a 'fallen star'. The corpses are of creatures which she fed upon
to grow up. Yechnagoth's psychic influence over other creatures allowed him to gain their
trust and respect, and call upon more of her kind "from the skies" to help him build the
army of hell Uria wanted to send to take over Irdya once a great enough connection was
made between both worlds.

Elynia remembers the Glyph that she had found in Argan's lair before. She reads it during
the Long Night, and learns the awful truth: the shaxthals won't stop consuming Irdya until
it is turned into a giant sphere of dirt.

The group decides that the remaining shaxthal hives must be destroyed - but they need
clues of their locations (besides the Wesmere one), and the only place where more information
could be found was buried into Hell - Argan's Lair.


*************************
Scenario 9: One must fall
*************************

Galas and the rest travel back to the Great Continent, but when reaching the coastline,
they are attacked by war ships controlled by the Iron Triad. The ship is sank, but they
manage to escape the slaughter -- only to land at enemy territory. They have arrived
to the Kalari Peninsula, where the Iron Triad headquarters are located. Eventually, they
get crushed by the triad members and Galas destroys Mal Kendria in a desperate attempt
to allow Elynia and Mal Keshar to escape, but gets himself killed by Mal Hekuba.
