General:
--------
* E1S1 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E1S3 requires rebalancing and/or rewriting to decrease difficulty while also
  making it harder to win by just sitting in a map corner.
* E1S5 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E1S7 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E1S8 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E1S9.2's sequence with Ivyel needs to be rewritten and the unit baseframe has
  to be completely remade. Also, increase overall difficulty.
* E1S10 requires rebalancing to decrease difficulty.
* E1S11.1 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty; in particular, there's
  one side using defensive grouping, which makes gameplay far too easy. It's
  not possible to change the grouping without changing other attributes to make
  sure this enemy side doesn't become nigh-invincible.
* E1S11.2 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E1S12 is planned to include a short appearance of Uria (projected) while
  Elynia is dying.
* E2S1 requires rebalancing to increase difficulty.
* E2S2 requires rebalancing to decrease difficulty.
* E2S4's ending cutscene needs to be revised to remove/rewrite bits of text to
  make the sequence as concise and unobtrusive as possible.
