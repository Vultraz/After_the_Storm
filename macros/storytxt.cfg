            story= _ "Some scenarios of this campaign work in a dramatically different way to that of Wesnoth's common gameplay. Therefore, it is especially important to pay close attention to the mission objectives and to not necessarily try to kill every single enemy, especially in shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn continuously.

Although not strictly a requirement, I recommend for players to have played or read the storylines behind <i>Descent into Darkness</i>, <i>Under the Burning Suns</i> and especially <i>Invasion from the Unknown</i>, to be familiar with some characters and historical events."

Our history is tainted with the blood of millions of our kinsmen. And that blood has been dried up by the light of Sela and Naia. Now not even the fire can burn and remove it."

In part, I was highly disappointed at the brash behavior of the new leaders of the elves; in my times only the eldest and wisest could rise as leaders of our kind.

I should have guessed that this would happen and that I'd have to concentrate my efforts in keeping our kin united under a single banner instead of spending so much time far from them.
