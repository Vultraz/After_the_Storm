It is especially important to pay close attention to the mission objectives and to not necessarily try to kill every single enemy, especially in shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn continuously.

Although not strictly required, players are advised to become familiar with the stories, characters, and historical events presented in <i>Descent into Darkness</i>, <i>Under the Burning Suns</i>, and especially <i>Invasion from the Unknown</i> before playing this campaign.

<b>If you have not completed Episodes I and II of <i>After the Storm</i>, you definitely should not play this episode yet.</b>"

Uria now has both the Ruby of Fire and Yechnagoth’s heart in her possession, allowing her to connect and invade our worlds. Without the Ruby, my power is severely diminished; and even with it, I could not possibly confront a creature of such power beyond imagination on my own.

With the Western Continent and the larger islands in the Vast Sea sunken, and most of the Great Continent either turned into a dead wasteland or controlled by our enemies, the odds of finding more people with the ability to help us are nil at this point.

I thought I could save Irdya from impending doom this time, but I failed. I failed, just like I did before, and again. All I have accomplished with my recklessness so far has been accelerating the process of our destruction. I have lost my friends and Argan to Ha’atel’s curse and assisted in the destruction of lands that once belonged to the civilization I vowed to protect long ago."

For a moment I had hoped none of what happened was more than just a bad dream, but it couldn’t be more real. Anya and Durvan found me after an entire day of searching in the nearby hills.

I had been badly injured by the fight with the lich, and my staff was gone. Elyssa’s appearance after my narrow escape was most certainly not a dream.

Elorran was right in his previous assessment of the situation. We should have destroyed the Ruby before embarking upon this pointless quest. This has all been my fault. Even before Uria centered her attention on Irdya... I had the opportunity to avoid all this."

She said that we should go back with the outcast Demon Lord in the Far North to decide what to do next. Elorran has many informants throughout Uria’s domain, and even Irdya.

I know I need to recover Argan’s journal more than anything, but the Grand Council has not spoken a word about it yet, and it’s possible our demon allies have gathered vital information about Uria and Elyssa’s plans by now. That is, assuming they are even working together. Both that woman and Mal Hekuba’s statements on the matter were too vague to conclude anything from them."
